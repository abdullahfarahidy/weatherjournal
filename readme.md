// weather App //

  This is project is considered the entry for me in back-end web developement, it includes : server-side, client side , async javascript.

 
 // Overview // 

* I have created an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 
* I used ES6 when writing the code.
* I made some modifying to HTML and CSS files to make the layout more simple as I can.
* I added a small tag to display the error message which comes from API.
* I used extention on the URL (&units=metric) to get the Celsius Temperature.
* I wrote comments to make the code more readable.

 // How to use // 

* All you should do is write the ZIP code of the city (United States).
* You can write your feelings if you want [optional].
* The application will show you.
